# SARSAmora - Reinforcement Learning library for Scala

SARSAmora is a Scala framework for reinforcement learning.  The
framework includes abstractions that separate environment interfaces
(including OpenAI's Gym using JEP and ScalaPy) and several different
state, action and policy representations from a variety of core
reinforcement learning algorithms.

The following learning algorithms are currently implemented:

* SARSA(0)
* Q-Learning
